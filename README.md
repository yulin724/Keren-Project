# Keren Project - Smart House at its best.

So at this point you may be wondering... What is the Keren Project?
The simplest way to explain it would be a revolutionary new AI capable of serving you to her fullest.
Whatever you need done, she will do with your consent.

# So what can she do now?

So far we have more or less implemented these features (and this is only a small part):

 - Speech recognition - within the SL4A, Android APP needed. (Thanks to Google Voice Recognition Android API)
 - Recognize the language - Credit to the Author Kent Johnson for the package used.
 - Text-to-Speech in any language - Not completely ready, code not included yet. (Thanks to Google Translate TTS)
 - Weather - Almost Ready. Update: Finished!
 - Profiles - Ready!
 - Log everything - Ready!
 - Verify legitimate requests - Ready! *Not included in the current client code.
 
 With upcoming features such as:

 - Air Conditioning Control.
 - TV Control.
 - Home Lights Control.
 - Coffee Machine automation (Yes!)
 - An Automatic Plant Watering System.
 - Online IP Camera(s) Control
 - Native android application. (A Regular APK)

# Bugs:

 [Solved] - UTF-8 Problem - Can't send Hebrew/Russian or other unique language strings.


[07/05/2013] Update: All the Server requests are being logged into the logging file,
		     you can't see the request message on the Server anymore, you don't need it anyway.
		     I'm working now on the command recognition in the server side, stay tuned!

[11/05/2013] Update: Added test module, Weather function complete, returning full sentece with the current weather condition.
 
We hope to see you contribute to our project.
